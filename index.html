                        would likely not recognize it as the same planet we inhabit today. The atmosphere was very
                        different from what we breathe today; at that time, it was likely a reducing atmosphere of
                        methane, ammonia, and other gases which would be toxic to most life on our planet today. Also
                        during this time, the Earth's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to
                        form.[1]</p>
                      <p class="card-text">It was early in the Archean that life first appeared on Earth. Our oldest
                        fossils date to roughly 3.5 billion years ago, and consist of bacteria microfossils. In fact,
                        all life during the more than one billion years of the Archean was bacterial. The Archean coast
                        was home to mounded colonies of photosynthetic bacteria called stromatolites. Stromatolites have
                        been found as fossils in early Archean rocks of South Africa and western Australia.
                        Stromatolites increased in abundance throughout the Archean, but began to decline during the
                        Proterozoic. They are not common today, but they are doing well in Shark Bay, Australia (see
                        photo below).[2]

                        During the Proterozoic, the atmosphere and oceans changed significantly. Proterozoic rocks
                        contain many definite traces of primitive life-forms—the fossil remains of bacteria and
                        blue-green algae, as well as of the first oxygen-dependent animals, the Ediacara fauna.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Free oxygen in the atmosphere increased significantly as a result of biological activity during
                        the Proterozoic. By the time eukaryotes became established in the environment, atmospheric
                        oxygen pressure had risen from low values to about 10 percent of the present atmospheric level
                        (PAL). Megascopic eukaryotes first appeared about 2.3 billion years ago and became widespread by
                        about 1.8 billion years ago. Eukaryotes employed a form of respiration and oxidative metabolism;
                        they had a central nucleus that could split into separate sex cells, and so for the first time a
                        mixed and variable genetic code could be passed to younger generations.

                        Early organisms on Earth flourished most easily in the shallow water of continental margins.
                        Such stable continental shelf environments, which were rare in the Archean, developed after 2.5
                        billion years ago, facilitating the growth of photosynthetic organisms and thus oxygen
                        production.[3]

                        The Cambrian period, part of the Paleozoic era, produced the most intense burst of evolution
                        ever known. The Cambrian Explosion saw an incredible diversity of life emerge, including many
                        major animal groups alive today. Among them were the chordates, to which vertebrates (animals
                        with backbones) such as humans belong.[4]
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        What sparked this biological bonanza isn't clear. It may be that oxygen in the atmosphere,
                        thanks to emissions from photosynthesizing cyanobacteria and algae, were at levels needed to
                        fuel the growth of more complex body structures and ways of living. The environment also became
                        more hospitable, with a warming climate and rising sea levels flooding low-lying landmasses to
                        create shallow, marine habitats ideal for spawning new life-forms.[4]
                      </p>
                      <h4><b>The Cambrian Explosion</b></h4>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Nevertheless, the scale of the Cambrian Explosion is likely exaggerated due to the proliferation
                        of hard-bodied animals that fossilized much more readily than their soft-bodied precursors.
                        These included brachiopods, which lived in shells resembling those of clams or cockles, and
                        animals with jointed, external skeletons known as arthropods—the ancestors of insects, spiders,
                        and crustaceans. These toughened-up creatures represented a crucial innovation: hard bodies
                        offering animals both a defense against enemies and a framework for supporting bigger body
                        sizes.[4]

                        The Ordovician is best known for its diverse marine invertebrates, including graptolites,
                        trilobites, brachiopods, and the conodonts (early vertebrates). A typical marine community
                        consisted of these animals, plus red and green algae, primitive fish, cephalopods, corals,
                        crinoids, and gastropods. More recently, tetrahedral spores that are similar to those of
                        primitive land plants have been found, suggesting that plants invaded the land at this time.[5]

                        From the Lower to Middle Ordovician, the Earth experienced a milder climate — the weather was
                        warm and the atmosphere contained a lot of moisture. However, when Gondwana finally settled on
                        the South Pole during the Upper Ordovician, massive glaciers formed, causing shallow seas to
                        drain and sea levels to drop. This likely caused the mass extinctions that characterize the end
                        of the Ordovician in which 60% of all marine invertebrate genera and 25% of all families went
                        extinct.[5]

                        Ordovician strata are characterized by numerous and diverse trilobites and conodonts (phosphatic

                        sandstone. In addition, blastoids, bryozoans, corals, crinoids, as well as many kinds of
                        brachiopods, snails, clams, and cephalopods appeared for the first time in the geologic record
                        in tropical Ordovician environments. Remains of ostracoderms (jawless, armored fish) from

                        The Silurian Period occurred from 443 million to 416 million years ago. It was the third period
                        in the Paleozoic Era. It followed the Ordovician Period and preceded the Devonian Period. During
                        this time, continental landmasses were low and sea levels were rising. This meant rich shallow
                        sea ecosystems with new ecological niches. Silurian fossils show evidence of extensive reef
                        building and the first signs that life beginning to colonize the new estuary, fresh water and
                        terrestrial ecosystems.[6]

                      <p class="card-text">

                        Much of the landmass that would become western North America was under a shallow ocean for much
                        of the Silurian Period. These shallow waters enabled sunlight to penetrate, and marine animals
                        underwent rapid differentiation. Silurian fossils show extensive coral reefs built from tabulate
                        and horn corals with calcium carbonate skeletons. In the early Silurian, a class of jawless
                        fish, Agnatha, similar to modern hagfish and lampreys, was most common. In the mid-Silurian, the
                        first species of Romundina, a Placoderm — a primitive armored fish with a cartilage skeleton —
                        is earliest fish known to have developed jaws.[6]

                        Eurypterids were the apex predators of the Silurian oceans. Eurypterids were arthropods,
                        probably most closely related to modern horseshoe crabs. They had a semi-circular anterior
                        carapace followed jointed section and a long tapering tail. Most species had two pairs of
                        jointed walking legs followed by a pair of paddle-shaped swimming appendages. Some had a spike
                        on the end of their tails, which may have been used to inject venom into prey, giving rise to
                        the common name “sea scorpion.” By the Devonian Period, these animals became the largest known
                        arthropods to ever have lived on Earth.[6]

                        During the Devonian, two major animal groups colonized the land. The first tetrapods —
                        land-living vertebrates — appeared during the Devonian, as did the first terrestrial arthropods,
                        including wingless insects and the earliest arachnids. In the oceans, brachiopods flourished.
                        Crinoids and other echinoderms, tabulate and rugose corals, and ammonites were also common. Many
                        new kinds of fish appeared.[7]
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        During the Devonian, there were three major continental masses: North America and Europe sat
                        together near the equator, with much of their current area covered by shallow seas. To the north
                        lay a portion of modern Siberia. A composite continent of South America, Africa, Antarctica,
                        India, and Australia dominated the southern hemisphere.[7]
                      </p>

                      <h4><b>The Devonian seas</b></h4>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        The Devonian seas were dominated by brachiopods, such as the spiriferids, and by tabulate and
                        rugose corals, which built large reefs in shallow waters. Encrusting red algae also contributed
                        to reef building. In the Lower Devonian, ammonoids appeared, leaving us large limestone deposits
                        from their shells. Bivalves, crinoid and blastoid echinoderms, graptolites, and trilobites were
                        all present, though most groups of trilobites disappeared by the close of the Devonian.[7]
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        The Devonian is also notable for the rapid diversification in fish. Benthic, jawless, armored
                        fish are common by the Lower Devonian. These early fish include a number of different groups. By
                        the the Middle Devonian, placoderms, the first jawed fish, appear. Many of these grew to large
                        sizes and were fearsome predators. Of the greatest interest to us is the rise of the first
                        sarcopterygians, the lobe-finned fish, which eventually produced the first tetrapods just before
                        the end of the Devonian.[7]

                      <h4><b> The Devonian landscape</b></h4>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        By the Devonian Period, colonization of the land was well underway. Before this time, there was
                        no organic accumulation in the soils, resulting in soils with a reddish color. This is
                        indicative of the underdeveloped landscape, probably colonized only by bacterial and algal mats.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        By the start of the Devonian, early terrestrial vegetation had begun to spread. These plants did
                        not have roots or leaves like most plants today, and many had no vascular tissue at all. They
                        probably spread vegetatively, rather than by spores or seeds, and did not grow much more than a
                        few centimeters tall. These plants included the now extinct zosterophylls and trimerophytes. The
                        early fauna living among these plants were primarily arthropods: mites, trigonotarbids, wingless
                        insects, and myriapods, though these early faunas are not well known.[7]
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        By the Late Devonian, lycophytes, sphenophytes, ferns, and progymnosperms had evolved. Most of
                        these plants have true roots and leaves, and many grew quite tall. The progymnosperm
                        Archaeopteris (see photo above) was a large tree with true wood. It was the oldest known tree
                        until the 2007 identification of Wattieza in 2007. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed
                        plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been
                        called the "Devonian Explosion." Along with this diversification in terrestrial vegetation
                        structure, came a diversification of the arthropods.[7]

                        During the Mississippian sea lilies dominated the seas and reptiles began to appear on land,
                        along with ferns. Shallow, warm seas supported dense meadows of crinoids and blastoids along
                        with corals, arthropods and mollusks. In North America these meadows left marine limestone
                        deposits, which distinguished the Mississippian from the later coal-rich, Pennsylvanian.
                        Crinoids and their relatives, blastoids, were so widespread in North America that the
                        Mississippian is known as the Age of Crinoids. Because crinoids are filter feeders the seas must
                        have been relatively clear, while their need for high calcium carbonate (CaCO3) concentrations
                        to build their skeletons points to a warm water environment. Bryozoans and brachiopods also
                        thrived in these shallow seas, but trilobites continued to decline. Ammonoids grazed in and on
                        the meadows of less mobile animals. Among the fishes sharks were especially common while bony
                        fishes included coelacanths, acanthodians, and lungfishes. The common open communications
                        between the continental shelves of this Period resulted in a marine fauna which was generally
                        distributed Worldwide.[8]
                        <br><br>
                        In the early Mississippian, diverse scrawny treeless forests replaced the Devonian forests
                        dominated by a single species of tree (Archeopteris). An increasingly lush flora evolved as the
                        period progressed, common plants soon included giant horsetails, tree ferns and conifer-like
                        trees (cordaites). The new flora provided ample food for arthropod herbivores and detrivores
                        such as millipedes and the newly evolved winged insects. These arthropods were in turn food for
                        arthropod and vertebrate predators. Amphibians diversified to include many forms of both
                        semi-aquatic and fully terrestrial species, which fed on the rich arthropod fauna and/or each
                        other.[8]
                        <br><br>
                        Both the Mississippian and the Pennsylvanian are now considered to be subperiods of the
                        Carboniferous Period. They are separated in the U.S. because of the different types of fossil
                        deposits commonly found for each subperiod, where much of the midwest was covered by shallow
                        seas giving limestone in the Mississippian, while the Pennsylvanian is dominated by coal
                        deposits from widespread swamps. A major marine extinction event, caused by a drop in sea level
                        that hit ammonoids and crinoids especially hard, distinguishes the Mississippian from the
                        Pennsylvanian periods in marine deposits.[9]
                        <br><br>
                        Although the Devonian ended with a series of glaciations and extinction events, the early
                        Mississippian saw the Earth in a greenhouse climate state with warm temperatures over much of
                        the globe. Gondwana continued its northward drift and collision with Euramerica, building the
                        Appalachian Mountains. Because the colliding landmass straddled the equator warm climatic
                        conditions were common over a wide range of its northern latitudes while southern Gondwana
                        remained glaciated. The drop in sea levels at the end of the Devonian was soon reversed in the
                        Mississippian. The widespread shallow seas on the continents resulted in the extensive limestone
                        and dolomite deposits in this Period, the last Period to see limestone (the major Mississippian
                        rock type) deposited by widespread seas on the North American continent.[9]

                      <p class="card-text">
                        The Pennsylvanian saw the disappearance of the warm, shallow seas of the Mississippian, causing
                        a dramatic change in marine life. The warm, clear seas of the Mississippian gave way to cool,
                        muddy waters resulting in a decline in crinoids from which they never recovered. On land coal
                        swamp forests thrived during this period. The dead plant material was laid down in huge amounts,
                        gradually forming today's coal. Insects ruled the air.[10]
                        <br><br>
                        Tropical forests of this Period provided the plant matter that later became the great coal
                        deposits of America and Europe. These rich deposits make these forest plants some of the best
                        known in Earth’s history. Dominant plants included giant club mosses and horsetails, tree ferns,
                        seed ferns and cordaites (conifer-like trees). Specimens of all but cordaites are displayed in
                        this case. Late Pennsylvanian temperate forests were dominated by cordaites. The vast amont of
                        carbon deposited as coal, rather than carbonate (CO32-), released oxygen into the atmosphere,
                        increasing atmospheric oxygen to 35% (vs. 21% today). This allowed the evolution of giant
                        invertebrates, for example, dragonflies with 70 cm (29 in) wingspans and two-meter long
                        millipedes.[10]
                        <br><br>
                        Pennsylvanian forests and swamps were home to a rich diversity of animals, particularly winged
                        insects. Insects and other arthropods were the main herbivores (vertebrates had not yet evolved
                        the complex digestive strategies needed to eat plants). This Period is known as the Age of
                        Amphibians due to their numbers and variety. These animals ate insects, other arthropods, and
                        each other. A crucial development of this Period was the evolution of the land adapted, membrane
                        enclosed (amniote) egg, allowing animals to live away from water. This advance enabled the
                        eventual conquest of land by reptiles, mammals, and birds.[10]
                        <br><br>
                        Significant glaciation marks the beginning of the Pennsylvanian with a resultant sea-level drop.
                        Earth was in an ice age with a climate much like today—ice on both poles with wet tropics near
                        the equator and temperate regions between. While the main mass of continents was connected,
                        fragments on the edges of the plates continued colliding and merging during this Period,
                        continuing the process of the formation of the supercontinent of Pangea (a process to be
                        completed by the early Triassic). This was also a time of mountain building as all of the
                        continents came together. With mountains came erosion and silt, resulting in muddy shallow
                        waters. As the continents moved about, corresponding climate changes occurred. Towards the end
                        of this period many swamps dried out, leading to the demise of giant plants.[10]

                      <p class="card-text">
                        Permian Period, in geologic time, the last period of the Paleozoic Era. The Permian Period began
                        298.9 million years ago and ended 252.2 million years ago, extending from the close of the
                        Carboniferous Period to the outset of the Triassic Period.[11]
                        <br><br>
                        At the beginning of the period, glaciation was widespread, and latitudinal climatic belts were
                        strongly developed. Climate warmed throughout the Permian times, and, by the end of the period,
                        hot and dry conditions were so extensive that they caused a crisis in Permian marine and
                        terrestrial life. This dramatic climatic shift may have been partially triggered by the assembly
                        of smaller continents into the supercontinent of Pangea. Most of Earth’s land area was
                        incorporated into Pangea, which was surrounded by an immense world ocean called Panthalassa.[11]
                        <br><br>
                        Terrestrial plants broadly diversified during the Permian Period, and insects evolved rapidly as
                        they followed the plants into new habitats. In addition, several important reptile lineages
                        first appeared during this period, including those that eventually gave rise to mammals in the
                        Mesozoic Era. The largest mass extinction in the Earth’s history occurred during the latter part
                        of the Permian Period. This mass extinction was so severe that only 10 percent or less of the
                        species present during the time of maximum biodiversity in the Permian survived to the end of
                        the period.[11]
                        <br><br>
                        Life during the Permian Period was very diverse—the marine life of the period was perhaps more
                        diverse than that of modern times. The gradual climatic warming that took place during the Early
                        Permian (Cisuralian) Epoch (298.9 million to 272.3 million years ago) encouraged great
                        evolutionary expansion (diversification) among both marine and terrestrial faunas that had
                        survived the relatively cold conditions of the Carboniferous Period. Many lineages entering
                        Early Permian times with only a few species and genera progressively diversified into new
                        families and superfamilies as the climate warmed. Communities became increasingly complex, and
                        generic diversity (diversity of organisms at genus level) increased through the midpoint of the
                        Middle Permian (Guadalupian) Epoch (272.3 million to 259.9 million years ago). Within the
                        tropical shallow-water marine communities, significant environmental changes occurring at the
                        end of the Middle Permian Epoch were so abrupt that many groups became extinct, and only a few
                        of the remaining groups survived into the Late Permian (Lopingian) Epoch (259.9 million to 252.2
                        million years ago).[11]
                        <br><br>
                        Terrestrial life in Permian times was closely keyed to the evolution of terrestrial plants,
                        which were the primary food source for land animals. The fossil plant record for the Early
                        Permian Epoch consists predominantly of ferns, seed ferns, and lycophytes (a group of vascular
                        plants containing club mosses and scale trees), which were adapted to marshes and swampy
                        environments. A less abundant Middle and Late Permian fossil record of early coniferophytes (a
                        group of vascular plants containing cycads, ginkoes, and gnetophytes) and protoangiosperms
                        (precursors to flowering plants) suggests a broad adaptation of these plant groups to
                        progressively drier areas.[12]
                        <br><br>
                        Evidence of broad plant diversification also is found in the rapid evolution of insects, which
                        quickly followed plants into new habitats. As these insects adapted to their new surroundings
                        and formed very specialized associations with plants, many new species emerged. Permian insects
                        included at least 23 orders, 11 of which are now extinct.[12]
                        <br><br>
                        The greatest mass extinction episodes in Earth’s history occurred in the latter part of the
                        Permian Period. Although much debate surrounds the timing of the Permian mass extinction, most
                        scientists agree that the episode profoundly affected life on Earth by eliminating about half of
                        all families, some 95 percent of marine species (nearly wiping out brachiopods and corals), and
                        about 70 percent of land species. Many geologists and paleontologists maintain that the
                        extinction events that took place during both the last stage of the Middle Permian Epoch and
                        throughout the Late Permian Epoch, each apparently more severe than the previous one, extended
                        over about 15 million years. Other scientists, however, argue that the extinction interval was
                        much more rapid, lasting only about 200,000 years with the bulk of the species loss occurring
                        over a 20,000-year span near the end of the period.[12]

                        The Triassic Period was the first period of the Mesozoic Era and occurred between 251 million
                        and 199 million years ago. It followed the great mass extinction at the end of the Permian
                        Period and was a time when life outside of the oceans began to diversify.[13]
                        <br><br>

                        At the beginning of the Triassic, most of the continents were concentrated in the giant C-shaped
                        supercontinent known as Pangaea. Climate was generally very dry over much of Pangaea with very
                        hot summers and cold winters in the continental interior. A highly seasonal monsoon climate
                        prevailed nearer to the coastal regions. Although the climate was more moderate farther from the
                        equator, it was generally warmer than today with no polar ice caps. Late in the Triassic,
                        seafloor spreading in the Tethys Sea led to rifting between the northern and southern portions
                        of Pangaea, which began the separation of Pangaea into two continents, Laurasia and Gondwana,
                        which would be completed in the Jurassic Period.[13]
                        <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Marine life</b></h4>

                      The oceans had been massively depopulated by the Permian Extinction when as many as 95 percent of
                      extant marine genera were wiped out by high carbon dioxide levels. Fossil fish from the Triassic
                      Period are very uniform, which indicates that few families survived the extinction. The mid- to
                      late Triassic Period shows the first development of modern stony corals and a time of modest reef
                      building activity in the shallower waters of the Tethys near the coasts of Pangaea.[13]
                      <br><br>

                      Early in the Triassic, a group of reptiles, the order Ichthyosauria, returned to the ocean.
                      Fossils of early ichthyosaurs are lizard-like and clearly show their tetrapod ancestry. Their
                      vertebrae indicate they probably swam by moving their entire bodies side to side, like modern
                      eels. Later in the Triassic, ichthyosaurs evolved into purely marine forms with dolphin-shaped
                      bodies and long-toothed snouts. Their vertebrae indicate they swam more like fish, using their
                      tails for propulsion with strong fin-shaped forelimbs and vestigial hind limbs. These streamlined
                      predators were air breathers and gave birth to live young. By the mid-Triassic, the ichthyosaurs
                      were dominant in the oceans. One genus, Shonisaurus, measured more than 50 feet long (15 meters)
                      and probably weighed close to 30 tons (27 metric tons). Plesiosaurs were also present but not as
                      large as those of the Jurassic Period.[13]
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Plants and insects</b></h4>

                      Plants and insects did not go through any extensive evolutionary advances during the Triassic. Due
                      to the dry climate, the interior of Pangaea was mostly desert. In higher latitudes, gymnosperms
                      survived and conifer forests began to recover from the Permian Extinction. Mosses and ferns
                      survived in coastal regions. Spiders, scorpions, millipedes and centipedes survived, as well as
                      the newer groups of beetles. The only new insect group of the Triassic was the grasshoppers.[13]
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Reptiles</b></h4>

                      The Mesozoic Era is often known as the Age of Reptiles. Two groups of animals survived the Permian
                      Extinction: Therapsids, which were mammal-like reptiles, and the more reptilian Archosaurs. In the
                      early Triassic, it appeared that the Therapsids would dominate the new era. One genus,
                      Lystrosaurus, has been called the Permian/Triassic “Noah,” as fossils of this animal predate the
                      mass extinction but are also commonly found in early Triassic strata. However, by the
                      mid-Triassic, most of the Therapsids had become extinct and the more reptilian Archosaurs were
                      clearly dominant.[14]
                      <br><br>

                      Archosaurs had two temporal openings in the skull and teeth that were more firmly set in the jaw
                      than those of their Therapsid contemporaries. The terrestrial apex predators of the Triassic were
                      the Rauisuchians, an extinct group of Archosaurs. In 2010, the fossilized skeleton of a newly
                      discovered species, Prestosuchus chiniquensis, measured more than 20 feet (6 meters) in length.
                      Unlike their close relatives the crocodilians, Rauisuchians had an upright stance but are
                      differentiated from true dinosaurs by the way that the pelvis and femur were arranged.[14]
                      <br><br>

                      Another lineage of Archosaurs evolved into true dinosaurs by the mid-Triassic. One genus,
                      Coelophysis, was bipedal. Although smaller than the Rauisuchians, they were probably faster as
                      they had a more flexibly jointed hip. Coelophysis also picked up speed by having lightweight
                      hollow bones. They had long sinuous necks, sharp teeth, clawed hands and a long bony tail.
                      Coelophysis fossils found in large numbers in New Mexico indicate the animal hunted in packs. Some
                      of the individuals found had remains of smaller members of the species inside the larger animals.
                      Scientists are unclear as to whether this indicates internal gestation or possibly cannibalistic
                      behavior.[14]
                      <br><br>

                      By the late Triassic, a third group of Archosaurs had branched into the first pterosaurs.
                      Sharovipteryx was a glider about the size of a modern crow with wing membranes attached to long
                      hind legs. It was obviously bipedal with tiny, clawed front limbs that were probably used to grasp
                      prey as it jumped and glided from tree to tree. Another flying reptile, Icarosaurus, was much
                      smaller, only the size of a hummingbird, with wing membranes sprouting from modified ribs.[14]
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Earliest mammals</b></h4>

                      The first mammals evolved near the end of the Triassic Period from the nearly extinct Therapsids.
                      Scientists have some difficulty in distinguishing where exactly the dividing line between
                      Therapsids and early mammals should be drawn. Early mammals of the late Triassic and early
                      Jurassic were very small, rarely more than a few inches in length. They were mainly herbivores or
                      insectivores and therefore were not in direct competition with the Archosaurs or later dinosaurs.
                      Many of them were probably at least partially arboreal and nocturnal as well. Most, such as the
                      shrew-like Eozostrodon, were egg layers although they clearly had fur and suckled their young.
                      They had three ear bones like modern mammals and a jaw with both mammalian and reptilian
                      characteristics.[14]

                        Jurassic Period, second of three periods of the Mesozoic Era. Extending from 201.3 million to
                        145 million years ago, it immediately followed the Triassic Period (251.9 million to 201.3
                        million years ago) and was succeeded by the Cretaceous Period (145 million to 66 million years
                        ago).
                        <br><br>
                        The Jurassic was a time of significant global change in continental configurations,
                        oceanographic patterns, and biological systems. During this period the supercontinent Pangea
                        split apart, allowing for the eventual development of what are now the central Atlantic Ocean
                        and the Gulf of Mexico. Heightened plate tectonic movement led to significant volcanic activity,
                        mountain-building events, and attachment of islands onto continents. Shallow seaways covered
                        many continents, and marine and marginal marine sediments were deposited, preserving a diverse
                        set of fossils. Rock strata laid down during the Jurassic Period have yielded gold, coal,
                        petroleum, and other natural resources.[15]
                        <br><br>
                        During the Early Jurassic, animals and plants living both on land and in the seas recovered from
                        one of the largest mass extinctions in Earth history. Many groups of vertebrate and invertebrate
                        organisms important in the modern world made their first appearance during the Jurassic. Life
                        was especially diverse in the oceans—thriving reef ecosystems, shallow-water invertebrate
                        communities, and large swimming predators, including reptiles and squidlike animals. On land,
                        dinosaurs and flying pterosaurs dominated the ecosystems, and birds made their first appearance.
                        Early mammals also were present, though they were still fairly insignificant. Insect populations
                        were diverse, and plants were dominated by the gymnosperms, or “naked-seed” plants.[15]
                        <br><br>

                      <h4><b>Jurassic life</b></h4>
                      The Triassic-Jurassic boundary is marked by one of the five largest mass extinctions on Earth.
                      About half of the marine invertebrate genera went extinct at this time; whether land plants or
                      terrestrial vertebrates suffered a similar extinction during this interval is unclear. In
                      addition, at least two other Jurassic intervals show heightened faunal turnover affecting mainly
                      marine invertebrates—one in Early Jurassic time and another at the end of the period.[15]
                      <br><br>
                      <h4><b>Marine life</b></h4>
                      The earliest Jurassic marine ecosystems show signs of recovery from the major mass extinction
                      that occurred at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. This extinction eliminated about half of marine
                      invertebrate genera and left some groups with very few surviving species. Diversity increased
                      rapidly for the first four million years (the Hettangian Age [201.3 million to 199.3 million
                      years ago] and the first part of the Sinemurian Age [199.3 million to 190.8 million years ago])
                      following this extinction and then slowed through the next five million years. Another
                      extinction event occurred among benthic (bottom-dwelling) invertebrates at the
                      Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary (about 183 million years ago) in the Early Jurassic,
                      interrupting the overall recovery and diversification. The last spiriferid brachiopod (abundant
                      during the Paleozoic Era) went extinct at this time, and in some regions 84 percent of bivalve
                      species went extinct. Although best documented in Europe, biodiversity during this period seems
                      to have decreased around the globe. The extinctions may be related to an onset of low-oxygen
                      conditions in epicontinental seas, as evidenced by the presence today of layers of organic-rich
                      shales, which must have been formed in seas with so little oxygen that no burrowing organisms
                      could survive and efficient breakdown of organic matter could not occur. Full recovery from this
                      extinction did not occur until the Middle Jurassic. It has been proposed that a final interval
                      of heightened extinction took place at the end of the Jurassic, although its magnitude and
                      global extent are disputed. This final turnover may have been limited to Eurasian regions
                      affected by local sea level decreases, or it may be related to a decrease in the quality of
                      fossil preservation through the Late Jurassic.[15]
                      <br><br>
                      Except for the extinction events outlined above, in general, marine invertebrates increased
                      their diversity and even modernized through the Jurassic. Some previously abundant Paleozoic
                      groups were extinct by the Jurassic, and other groups were present but no longer dominant.
                      Moreover, many important modern groups first appeared in the fossil record during the Jurassic,
                      and many important groups experienced high levels of diversification (a process known as
                      evolutionary radiation).[16]
                      <br><br>
                      A diverse group of vertebrates swam in Jurassic seas. Cartilaginous and bony fishes were
                      abundant. Large fishes and marine reptiles were common; the largest bony fish ever to live
                      existed at this time, and Jurassic pliosaurs (see plesiosaur) are some of the largest
                      carnivorous reptiles ever discovered.[16]
                      <br><br>

                      <h4><b>Protists and invertebrates</b></h4>
                      Among the plankton—floating, single-celled, microscopic organisms—two significant new groups
                      originated and radiated rapidly: coccolithophores and foraminifera. In addition, diatoms are
                      considered by some scholars to have originated in the Late Jurassic and radiated during the
                      Cretaceous. The skeletons of all three groups are major contributors to deep-sea sediments.
                      Before the explosion of skeletonized planktonic organisms, carbonates were mainly deposited in
                      shallow-water, nearshore environments. Today the tests (shells) of coccolithophores and
                      foraminifera account for significant volumes of carbonate sediments in the deep sea, while
                      diatom tests create silica-rich sediments. Thus, the advent of these groups has significantly
                      changed the geochemistry of the oceans, the nature of the deep-sea floor, and marine food
                      webs.[16]
                      <br><br>
                      Mollusks became dominant in marine ecosystems, both among swimmers in the water column (nekton)
                      and organisms living on the seafloor (benthos). Nektic cephalopods, such as shelled ammonites
                      and squidlike belemnites with internal skeletons, were very common. Although only one group of
                      ammonites survived the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction, they radiated rapidly into many
                      different forms. Because their shells have elaborate suture lines, they are easily identifiable;
                      this quality, along with their abundance and rapid evolution, make them useful as index fossils
                      for correlating and sequencing rocks. Thus, ammonites are a major tool for developing relative
                      time scales and dividing the Jurassic into finer time intervals. Other common mollusks include
                      bivalves (pelecypods) and snails (gastropods). These forms diversified into a number of
                      different niches. Among the bivalves, scallops (pectinids) and oysters show marked radiation.
                      Some bivalves also are used as index fossils.
                      Common echinoderms include crinoids (sea lilies), echinoids (sea urchins), and sea stars
                      (starfish). Jurassic crinoids are descendants from the one group that survived the
                      Permian-Triassic mass extinction. Their circular or star-shaped stem ossicles (plates) can be
                      quite abundant in Jurassic sediments. Under special circumstances, articulated Jurassic crinoids
                      are preserved; some of these fossils suggest that some species may have lived on floating logs
                      and not on the seafloor. One group of regular sea urchins, radially symmetrical and living on
                      the surface of the seafloor, radiated into a number of irregular echinoid groups (heart urchins)
                      that could burrow into sediment.[16]
                      <br><br>
                      Some lophophorates (brachiopods, or lamp shells) and bryozoa (moss animals) underwent recovery
                      and diversification in the Jurassic but never became as dominant as they were in the Paleozoic
                      Era. Spiriferid brachiopods went extinct during the Early Jurassic extinction event, but
                      rhynchonellid and terebratulid brachiopods can be found throughout the period.[16]
                      <br><br>
                      Among bryozoans that survived into the Jurassic, cyclostomes are found encrusting hard
                      substrates; cheilostomes (the most common modern bryozoan) appeared in the Late Jurassic. With
                      the extinction of trilobites, a new set of arthropods developed. The first true crabs and
                      lobsters appeared, bearing large front claws adapted for predation. Shrimp burrows are not
                      uncommon in Jurassic sediments, and fossil shrimp are occasionally preserved. Ostracods—small
                      crustaceans—radiated during the Jurassic and are used today as index fossils.[16]
                      <br><br>
                      Unlike today’s world, where virtually all reefs are formed by scleractinian corals, Jurassic
                      reefs and mounds were constructed by a variety of invertebrate organisms. Buildups were
                      constructed by siliceous sponges and serpulid tube worms as well as corals. Stromatolite mounds
                      were formed by communities of algae, bacteria, and other microorganisms. These reefs also had a
                      diverse set of fauna associated with them.[16]
                      <br><br>
                      The ecology of the seas was changed by the diversification of marine fauna and by the
                      adaptations of these new organisms. With the evolution and radiation of more-effective predators
                      (crabs, snails, echinoderms, and marine vertebrates), predation pressures began to increase
                      rapidly. For this reason, the Jurassic marks the start of the “Mesozoic Marine Revolution”—an
                      arms race between predators and prey that led to increased diversification of marine fauna. For
                      example, increased levels of burrowing are found in Jurassic sediments, along with an increase
                      in the maximum depth of burrowing. These increases may have developed as a predator-avoidance
                      adaptation, with organisms evolving that were capable of burrowing into sediment, but the
                      activity had far-reaching effects. Burrowing changed the nature of the seafloor, the utilization
                      of resources and space, and sedimentation style.[16]
                      <br><br>

                      <h4><b>Vertebrates</b></h4>
                      Along with invertebrate fauna, a diverse group of vertebrates inhabited Jurassic seas. Some of
                      them are related to modern groups, while others are now completely extinct. Chondrichthians
                      (cartilaginous fishes including sharks) and bony fishes were common. Teleosts—the dominant type
                      of fish today—began to acquire a more modern look as they developed bony (ossified) vertebrae
                      and showed considerable change in their bone structure, fins, and tail. The largest bony fish of
                      all time, Leedsichthys, measuring 20 metres (66 feet) long, lived during the Jurassic.

                      Large marine reptiles were common denizens of Jurassic seas. Ichthyosaurs had sleek profiles
                      similar to those of modern fast-swimming fish and had large eye orbits, perhaps the largest of
                      any vertebrate ever. Jurassic pliosaurs (short-necked plesiosaurs) could be about 15 metres (50
                      feet) long and are some of the largest carnivorous reptiles ever found—even rivaling
                      Tyrannosaurus, which lived during the subsequent Cretaceous Period. Fossils of large crocodiles
                      and elasmosaurs (long-necked plesiosaurs) are also found in Jurassic marine rocks.[15]

                      <h4><b>Terrestrial life</b></h4>

                      <h6><b>Invertebrates</b></h6>
                      Insects constitute the most abundant terrestrial invertebrates found in the Jurassic fossil
                      record. Groups include the odonates (damselflies and dragonflies), coleopterans (beetles),
                      dipterans (flies), and hymenopterans (bees, ants, and wasps). The discovery of Jurassic
                      bees—which today are dependent upon flowering plants (angiosperms)—suggests either the early
                      presence of angiosperms or that bees were originally adapted to other strategies. Snails,
                      bivalves, and ostracods are preserved in freshwater deposits.[15]
                      <br><br>

                      <h6><b>Vertebrates</b></h6>
                      Because of poor preservation of terrestrial deposits and their fossils, it is unclear whether
                      the mass extinction at the end of the Triassic had the same impact on terrestrial ecosystems as
                      it did in the oceans. However, there was a distinct change in vertebrate fauna by the Early
                      Jurassic. In Triassic terrestrial ecosystems, synapsids and therapsids—ancestors of modern
                      mammals and their relatives, often called “mammal-like reptiles”—were dominant. They occupied
                      several ecological niches and grew to large sizes. By the start of the Jurassic, these groups
                      became rare, a minor component of fossil assemblages; individuals were very small—no larger than
                      squirrel-sized—and their teeth and skeletal anatomy show that the early mammals were probably
                      omnivorous (eating plants and animals) or insectivorous. Instead, the archosaurs (dinosaurs,
                      crocodiles, and pterosaurs) were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates. It is not clear why this
                      change from synapsid-dominated to archosaur-dominated faunas occurred; it could be related to
                      the Triassic-Jurassic extinctions or to adaptations that allowed the archosaurs to outcompete
                      the mammals and mammalian ancestors (at least until the end of the Mesozoic Era). In the Late
                      Jurassic, while some marine invertebrates were going extinct, terrestrial vertebrates may also
                      have experienced a drop in diversity, but the evidence here, too, is inconclusive.[15]
                      <br><br>
                      Pterosaurs were common throughout the Jurassic. With light skeletons and wing structure
                      supported by a single digit on each “hand,” they were adapted to flying and gliding.[15]
                      <br><br>
                      The dinosaurs are divided into two groups based on a number of skeletal characteristics: the
                      saurischians (lizard-hipped) and the ornithischians (bird-hipped). The pubic bone of the
                      saurischians pointed forward, while the ornithischians had an extension that pointed backward.[15]
                      <br><br>
                      The saurischians, including sauropods and all carnivorous dinosaurs, were the earliest
                      dinosaurs. Sauropods (including Apatosaurus) appeared in the Early Jurassic and reached the peak
                      of their diversity, abundance, and body size in the Late Jurassic. Sauropods were generally
                      long-necked and probably adapted to browsing on the leaves of tall gymnosperms. Their decline in
                      the latest Jurassic appears to have corresponded to a decline in this type of vegetation.[15]
                      <br><br>
                      Carnivorous saurischians, the theropods, include Allosaurus. The earliest allosaur is from the
                      Middle Jurassic. Many of the theropods were globally distributed in the Jurassic. The origin of
                      birds is still debated, but it is generally accepted that birds descended from small theropods
                      during the Jurassic, and paleontologists consider them feathered dinosaurs. One of the earliest
                      feathered dinosaur fossils discovered is Archaeopteryx. Despite its feathers, Archaeopteryx was
                      saurischian in appearance: it had teeth, a tail like that of a lizard, and claws at the wing
                      tips, and it lacked a strong breastbone keel for flight muscle attachment.[15]
                      <br><br>
                      The ornithischians were all herbivorous and included Stegosaurus and Seismosaurus. By the
                      Jurassic the earliest bipedal ornithopods had diversified into armoured dinosaurs and
                      quadrupedal forms. The presence of heavy plates, spikes, and horns on various dinosaurs suggests
                      that predatory pressures from the theropods may have been intense; however, some of the
                      ornamentation also may have been used against other dinosaurs of the same species.[15]
                      <br><br>
                      Other reptiles, including turtles, were present throughout the Jurassic, while modern forms of
                      lizards made their appearance in the Late Jurassic. Amphibians present during the Triassic
                      Period declined drastically by the Jurassic, and more modern forms developed, such as the first
                      frog with the type of skeletal characteristics seen today.[15]
                      <br><br>

                      <h4><b>Plants</b></h4>
                      Although no new major plant groups originated during this time, Jurassic plant communities
                      differed considerably from their predecessors. The seed-fern floras, such as Glossopteris of
                      Gondwana, disappeared at or near the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Their demise may be related to
                      the mass extinction seen in marine ecosystems. True ferns were present during the Jurassic, but
                      gymnosperms (“naked-seed” plants) dominated the terrestrial ecosystem. Gymnosperms originated in
                      the Paleozoic Era and include three groups: cycads and cycadeoids, conifers, and ginkgos. All
                      have exposed seeds and rely on wind dispersal for reproduction. The cycads (including the modern
                      sago palm) and the extinct cycadeoids are palmlike gymnosperms. They proliferated to such an
                      extent that the Jurassic has been called the “Age of Cycads.” The conifers (cone-bearing plants
                      such as modern pine trees) also made up a large part of Jurassic forests. Almost all modern
                      conifers had originated by the end of the Jurassic. The ginkgo, a fruit-bearing gymnosperm that
                      is represented today by only one living species, was fairly widespread during the Jurassic.[16]
                      <br><br>
                      The first undisputed fossil evidence for angiosperms (flowering plants) is not found until the
                      Cretaceous Period. However, some pollen material similar to that of angiosperms has been
                      reported in rocks of Jurassic age. Also present are fossils of insects whose present-day
                      descendants depend upon angiosperms, suggesting that angiosperms may indeed have been present by
                      Jurassic times.[16]

                        Cretaceous Period, in geologic time, the last of the three periods of the Mesozoic Era. The
                        Cretaceous began 145.0 million years ago and ended 66 million years ago; it followed the
                        Jurassic Period and was succeeded by the Paleogene Period (the first of the two periods into
                        which the Tertiary Period was divided). The Cretaceous is the longest period of the Phanerozoic
                        Eon. Spanning 79 million years, it represents more time than has elapsed since the extinction of
                        the dinosaurs, which occurred at the end of the period.[17]
                        <br><br>

                        The Cretaceous Period began with Earth’s land assembled essentially into two continents,
                        Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south. These were almost completely separated by the
                        equatorial Tethys seaway, and the various segments of Laurasia and Gondwana had already started
                        to rift apart. North America had just begun pulling away from Eurasia during the Jurassic, and
                        South America had started to split off from Africa, from which India, Australia, and Antarctica
                        were also separating. When the Cretaceous Period ended, most of the present-day continents were
                        separated from each other by expanses of water such as the North and South Atlantic Ocean. At
                        the end of the period, India was adrift in the Indian Ocean, and Australia was still connected
                        to Antarctica.[17]
                        <br><br>

                        The climate was generally warmer and more humid than today, probably because of very active
                        volcanism associated with unusually high rates of seafloor spreading. The polar regions were
                        free of continental ice sheets, their land instead covered by forest. Dinosaurs roamed
                        Antarctica, even with its long winter night.[17]
                        <br><br>

                        The lengthy Cretaceous Period constitutes a major portion of the interval between ancient
                        life-forms and those that dominate Earth today. Dinosaurs were the dominant group of land
                        animals, especially “duck-billed” dinosaurs (hadrosaurs), such as Shantungosaurus, and horned
                        forms, such as Triceratops. Giant marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and
                        plesiosaurs were common in the seas, and flying reptiles (pterosaurs) dominated the sky.
                        Flowering plants (angiosperms) arose close to the beginning of the Cretaceous and became more
                        abundant as the period progressed. The Late Cretaceous was a time of great productivity in the
                        world’s oceans, as borne out by the deposition of thick beds of chalk in western Europe, eastern
                        Russia, southern Scandinavia, the Gulf Coast of North America, and western Australia. The
                        Cretaceous ended with one of the greatest mass extinctions in the history of Earth,
                        exterminating the dinosaurs, marine and flying reptiles, and many marine invertebrates.[17]
                        <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Cretaceous life</b></h4>
                      The Cretaceous Period is biologically significant because it is a major part of the transition
                      from the early life-forms of the Paleozoic Era to the advanced diversity of the current Cenozoic
                      Era. For example, most if not all of the flowering plants (angiosperms) made their first
                      appearance during the Cretaceous. Although dinosaurs were the dominant animals of the period, many
                      modern animals, including the placental mammals, made their debut during the Cretaceous. Other
                      groups—such as clams and snails, snakes and lizards, and most fishes—developed distinctively
                      modern characteristics before the mass extinction marking the end of the period.[17]
                      <br><br>

                      <h4><b>Marine life</b></h4>
                      The marine realm can be divided into two paleobiogeographic regions, the Tethyan and the boreal.
                      This division is based on the occurrence of rudist-dominated organic reeflike structures. Rudists
                      were large, rather unusual bivalves that had one valve shaped like a cylindrical vase and another
                      that resembled a flattened cap. The rudists were generally dominant over the corals as framework
                      builders. They rarely existed outside the Tethyan region, and the few varieties found elsewhere
                      did not create reeflike structures. Rudist reeflike structures of Cretaceous age serve as
                      reservoir rocks for petroleum in Mexico, Venezuela, and the Middle East.[17]
                      <br><br>
                      Other organisms almost entirely restricted to the Tethys region were actaeonellid and nerineid
                      snails, colonial corals, calcareous algae, larger bottom-dwelling (benthic) foraminiferans, and
                      certain kinds of ammonites and echinoids. In contrast, belemnites were apparently confined to the
                      colder boreal waters. Important bivalves of the boreal realm were the reclining forms (e.g.,
                      Exogyra and Gryphaea) and the inoceramids, which were particularly widespread and are now useful
                      for distinguishing among biostratigraphic zones.[17]
                      <br><br>
                      Marine plankton took on a distinctly modern appearance by the end of the Cretaceous. The
                      coccolithophores became so abundant in the Late Cretaceous that vast quantities accumulated to
                      form the substance for which the Cretaceous Period was named—chalk. The planktonic foraminiferans
                      also contributed greatly to fine-grained calcareous sediments. Less-abundant but important
                      single-celled animals and plants of the Cretaceous include the diatoms, radiolarians, and
                      dinoflagellates. Other significant marine forms of minute size were the ostracods and
                      calpionellids.[17]

                      Ammonites were numerous and were represented by a variety of forms ranging from the more-usual
                      coiled types to straight forms. Some of the more-unusual ammonites, called heteromorphs, were
                      shaped like fat corkscrews and hairpins. Such aberrant forms most certainly had difficulty moving
                      about. Ammonites preyed on other free-swimming or benthic invertebrates and were themselves prey
                      to many larger animals, including the marine reptiles called mosasaurs.[17]
                      <br><br>
                      Other marine reptiles were the long-necked plesiosaurs and the more fishlike ichthyosaurs. Sharks
                      and rays (chondrichthians) also were marine predators, as were the teleost (ray-finned) fishes.
                      One Cretaceous fish, Xiphactinus, grew to more than 4.5 metres (15 feet) and is the largest known
                      teleost.[17]

                      <h4><b>Terrestrial life</b></h4>
                      Although the fossil record is irregular in quality and quantity for the Early Cretaceous, it is
                      obvious that dinosaurs continued their lengthy dominance of the land. The Late Cretaceous record
                      is much more complete, particularly in the case of North America and Asia. It is known, for
                      instance, that during the Late Cretaceous many dinosaur types lived in relationships not unlike
                      the present-day terrestrial mammal communities. Although the larger dinosaurs, such as the
                      carnivorous Tyrannosaurus and the herbivorous Iguanodon, are the best-known, many smaller forms
                      also lived in Cretaceous times. Triceratops, a large three-horned dinosaur, inhabited western
                      North America during the Maastrichtian Age. The titanosaurs, a group of sauropods that included
                      Argentinosaurus and Dreadnoughtus, emerged during the second half of the period and were the
                      largest land animals that ever lived.[18]
                      <br><br>
                      Various types of small mammals that are now extinct existed during the Triassic and Jurassic, but
                      two important groups of modern mammals evolved during the Cretaceous. Placental mammals, which
                      include most modern mammals (e.g., rodents, cats, whales, cows, and primates), evolved during the
                      Late Cretaceous. Although almost all were smaller than present-day rabbits, the Cretaceous
                      placentals were poised to take over terrestrial environments as soon as the dinosaurs vanished.
                      Another mammal group, the marsupials, evolved during the Cretaceous as well. This group includes
                      the native species of Australia, such as kangaroos and koalas, and the North American opossum.[18]
                      <br><br>
                      In the air, the flying reptiles called pterosaurs dominated. One pterosaur, Quetzalcoatlus, from
                      the latest Cretaceous of what is now Texas (U.S.), had a wingspan of about 15 metres (49 feet).
                      Birds developed from a reptilian ancestor during the Jurassic and Cretaceous. Hesperornis was a
                      Cretaceous genus of flightless diving bird that had large feet and sharp backward-directed teeth
                      adapted for preying on fish.[18]
                      <br><br>
                      The land plants of the Early Cretaceous were similar to those of the Jurassic. They included the
                      cycads, ginkgoes, conifers, and ferns. The flowering plants (angiosperms) appeared in the Early
                      Cretaceous, became common by the beginning of the middle of the Cretaceous, and came to represent
                      the major component of the landscape by the mid-to-late Cretaceous. The oldest known fossil
                      angiosperm is Montsechia vidalii, an aquatic plant that has been dated to 130 million to 125
                      million years ago. The angiosperm group included figs, magnolias, poplars, willows, sycamores, and
                      herbaceous plants. With the advent of many new plant types, insects also diversified.[18]
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Mass Extinction</b></h4>
                      At or very close to the end of the Cretaceous Period, many animals that were important elements of
                      the Mesozoic world became extinct. On land the dinosaurs perished, but plant life was less
                      affected. Of the planktonic marine flora and fauna, only about 13 percent of the coccolithophore
                      and planktonic foraminiferan genera survived the extinction. Ammonites and belemnites became
                      extinct, as did such marine reptiles as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs. Among the marine
                      benthos, the larger foraminiferans (orbitoids) died out, and the hermatypic corals were reduced to
                      about one-fifth of their genera. Rudist bivalves disappeared, as did bivalves with a reclining
                      life habit, such as Exogyra and Gryphaea. The stratigraphically important inoceramids also died
                      out. Overall, approximately 80 percent of animal species disappeared, making this one of the
                      largest mass extinctions in Earth’s history.[18]

                        The Paleogene Period* is the first of three periods comprising the Cenozoic Era. The Cenozoic,
                        sometimes known as the "Age of Mammals", as the Mesozoic was the "Age of Reptiles", is known by
                        its Epochs. The Paleogene is composed of the first three of these Epochs, (Paleocene, Eocene,
                        and Oligocene Epochs). Four additional Epochs comprise the Neogene and Quaternary Periods that
                        are to follow. The Paleogene sees the rapid filling of the environment following the K/T
                        extinction, though it took more than two million years for the Earth’s ecosystems to recover
                        from this event. On land primitive mammals and birds began to spread rapidly. In the seas
                        planktonic foraminifera and nanofossils begin new evolutionary paths. Most marine life resembles
                        modern forms: the wonder of Cenozoic fossils is seeing recognizable organisms cast in stone,
                        rather than the exotic, 'alien' life forms, such as sea lilies, ammonoids, and trilobites, of
                        the Mesozoic and Paleozoic Eras.
                        <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Paleocene Epoch (65.5–55.8 Ma)</b></h4>

                      Paleocene Epoch, also spelled Palaeocene Epoch, first major worldwide division of rocks and time
                      of the Paleogene Period, spanning the interval between 66 million and 56 million years ago. The
                      Paleocene Epoch was preceded by the Cretaceous Period and was followed by the Eocene Epoch. The
                      Paleocene is subdivided into three ages and their corresponding rock stages: the Danian,
                      Selandian, and Thanetian.
                      <br><br>

                      One of the most striking features of vertebrate life in the Paleocene Epoch was the complete
                      absence of dinosaurs and other reptilian groups that were dominant during the preceding Cretaceous
                      Period. Another striking feature was the rapid proliferation and evolution of mammals. Paleocene
                      mammals included representatives of many groups or orders that still exist today, though the
                      Paleocene forms were mostly archaic (that is, descended from yet earlier forms) or highly
                      specialized. Paleocene mammals included Cretaceous species such as opossum-like marsupials and,
                      especially, the archaic and unusual multituberculates—herbivorous animals that had teeth very
                      similar in some respects to those of the later, more advanced rodents. The condylarths—hoofed
                      animals that were very important members of the Paleocene animal kingdom—included forms that were
                      evolving toward herbivorousness while still retaining insectivorous-carnivorous traits of their
                      Cretaceous ancestors. Primates became more abundant in the middle Paleocene; they displayed
                      characteristics intermediate between the insectivores and the lemurs, especially in their dental
                      anatomy.[19]
                      <br><br>

                      Late in the Paleocene, mammalian evolution showed a trend toward larger forms and more varied
                      assemblages. Primitive mammalian carnivores—notably the creodonts (a group of catlike and doglike
                      animals)—appeared, as did large herbivores, ancestral rodents, and the first known supposed
                      primates. The Gashato fauna from Mongolia contains the remains of the earliest known hare
                      (Eurymylus), and among Paleocene mammal remains from South America are many early representatives
                      of animals that became dominant in subsequent epochs of the Paleogene Period.[19]
                      <br><br>

                      Life in the early Paleocene oceans took hundreds of thousands to millions of years to recover from
                      the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous Period, but by Late Paleocene times many
                      groups of marine invertebrate animals had diversified considerably, including mollusks and
                      plankton. Highly fossiliferous marine sediments from the Upper Paleocene are well known along the
                      Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains of North America.[19]
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Eocene Epoch (55.8–33.9 Ma)</b></h4>

                      Eocene Epoch, second of three major worldwide divisions of the Paleogene Period (66 million to 23
                      million years ago) that began 56 million years ago and ended 33.9 million years ago. It follows
                      the Paleocene Epoch and precedes the Oligocene Epoch. The Eocene is often divided into Early (56
                      million to 47.8 million years ago), Middle (47.8 million to 38 million years ago), and Late (38
                      million to 33.9 million years ago) epochs. The name Eocene is derived from the Greek eos, for
                      “dawn,” referring to the appearance and diversification of many modern groups of organisms,
                      especially mammals and mollusks.
                      <br><br>
                      Among terrestrial vertebrates, the start of the Eocene is marked by the appearance of two new
                      groups of animals: the perissodactyls, or odd-toed ungulates, and the artiodactyls, or even-toed
                      ungulates. The perissodactyls include the horses, rhinoceroses, and tapirs; among the artiodactyls
                      are the deer, cattle, and sheep. An early horse ancestor, the dawn horse, known in North America
                      as Eohippus, is among the fossil perissodactyls found in the lower Eocene rocks of both North
                      America and Europe. Artiodactyls, rare during the early Eocene, became abundant later in the
                      epoch.[19]
                      <br><br>

                      Archaic primate forms from the Paleocene Epoch declined during the Eocene as many of their
                      ecological niches were usurped by the more-efficient rodents. Vertebrate groups arising during the
                      Middle Eocene were not as widespread as those of the early Eocene; the isolation that resulted
                      allowed different evolutionary trends to occur in the ungulate groups of North America and Europe.
                      By late in the Eocene Epoch this isolation had ceased, and North American and European groups once
                      again came into contact with one another.[19]
                      <br><br>

                      The Eocene Epoch marks the first appearance in the fossil record of the two completely marine
                      mammal groups, the cetaceans (whales, porpoises, and dolphins) and the sirenians (akin to the
                      modern manatees and dugongs). Similarly, the Eocene provides the first elephant-like animals and
                      the early bats. In addition, gastropods (a class of mollusks containing snails, slugs, and
                      limpets) underwent great diversification, and many bird orders that were in essence modern
                      appeared during the Eocene.[19]
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Oligocene Epoch (33.9–23.0 Ma)</b></h4>

                      Oligocene Epoch, third and last major worldwide division of the Paleogene Period (65.5 million to
                      23 million years ago), spanning the interval between 33.9 million to 23 million years ago. The
                      Oligocene Epoch is subdivided into two ages and their corresponding rock stages: the Rupelian and
                      the Chattian. It followed the Eocene Epoch and was succeeded by the Miocene Epoch, the first epoch
                      of the Neogene Period. The term Oligocene is derived from Greek and means the “epoch of few recent
                      forms,” referring to the sparseness of the number of modern animals that originated during that
                      time.[19]
                      <br><br>

                      In western Europe the beginning of the Oligocene was marked by an invasion of the sea that brought
                      with it new mollusks characteristic of the epoch. Marine conditions did not exist for long,
                      however, and brackish and freshwater conditions soon prevailed. This cycle of marine
                      transgression, followed by the establishment of brackish and then freshwater environments, was
                      repeated during the Oligocene. Sediments on the floor of the ancient Tethyan Sea, which covered
                      part of Eurasia during the Oligocene, were deformed early in the development of the European
                      Alps.[19]
                      <br><br>

                      Oligocene climates appear to have been temperate, and many regions enjoyed subtropical climatic
                      conditions. Grasslands expanded and forested regions dwindled during this time, while tropical
                      vegetation flourished along the borders of the Tethyan Sea. Warm, swampy conditions prevailed over
                      much of what is now Germany, and extensive deposits of lignite coal were formed.[19]
                      <br><br>

                      A prominent group of Oligocene marine organisms were the foraminiferans, protists similar to
                      amoebas but bearing a complex, often calcareous test, or shell. Among the especially prominent
                      foraminiferans were the nummulites (large, lens-shaped foraminiferans). Other marine forms were
                      essentially modern in aspect. Terrestrial invertebrate life was abundant and diverse. Stream and
                      lake deposits on the Isle of Wight in England contain the remains, often well preserved, of
                      termites and other insects. In the Baltic, many forms of Oligocene insects, including butterflies,
                      bees, ants, and spiders, are preserved in amber.[19]
                      <br><br>

                      Oligocene terrestrial vertebrate faunas are diverse and abundant and are known from North America,
                      Europe, Africa, and Asia. The vertebrates of the northern continents possess an essentially modern
                      aspect that is more a result of the extinction of archaic vertebrates at the close of the Eocene
                      Epoch than the appearance of new forms. The similarities between the various early Oligocene
                      vertebrate faunas of the northern continents suggests a relatively free interchange of animals,
                      but later Oligocene faunas show a greater degree of provincialism. Early pigs and peccaries first
                      appeared in Europe during the early Oligocene and reached North America late in the epoch. Bats
                      became more widespread during the Oligocene and at least locally abundant; their droppings in
                      caves contributed to the formation of extensive phosphate deposits that are now economically
                      significant in many areas.[19]
                      <br><br>

                      Throughout the epoch, modern groups of carnivores and herbivores became diverse and abundant. The
                      largest land mammal of all time, Indricotherium (a sort of giant hornless rhinoceros), is known
                      from Asia, and the first mastodons are known from Egypt. In North America, primitive horses were
                      evolving, including three-toed forms such as Mesohippus and Miohippus. Primitive beavers also
                      appeared late in the Oligocene.[19]
                      <br><br>

                      The earliest apelike form, Parapithecus, is known from Oligocene deposits in Egypt, which also
                      have yielded remains of several kinds of Old World monkeys. The earliest New World monkeys are
                      known from late Oligocene deposits in South America. During the Oligocene, South America was
                      isolated from Central and North America, and a unique mammalian fauna developed there. Remarkably,
                      many South American mammals of the Oligocene exhibit extreme parallelism in adaptation to forms
                      that are found elsewhere in the world and to which they are not closely related.[19]

                        Neogene Period, the second of three divisions of the Cenozoic Era. The Neogene Period
                        encompasses the interval between 23 million and 2.6 million years ago and includes the Miocene
                        (23 million to 5.3 million years ago) and the Pliocene (5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago)
                        epochs. The Neogene, which means “new born,” was designated as such to emphasize that the marine
                        and terrestrial fossils found in the strata of this time were more closely related to each other
                        than to those of the preceding period, called the Paleogene (66 million to 23 million years
                        ago). The term Neogene is widely used in Europe as a geologic division, and it is increasingly
                        employed in North America, where the Cenozoic Era has traditionally been divided into the
                        Tertiary Period (66 million to 2.6 million years ago) and the Quaternary Period (2.6 million
                        years ago to the present).[20]
                        <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Miocene Epoch</b></h4>
                      Miocene Epoch, earliest major worldwide division of the Neogene Period (23 million years to 2.6
                      million years ago) that extended from 23 million to 5.3 million years ago. It is often divided
                      into the Early Miocene Epoch (23 million to 16 million years ago), the Middle Miocene Epoch (16
                      million to 11.6 million years ago), and the Late Miocene Epoch (11.6 million to 5.3 million years
                      ago). The Miocene may also be divided into six ages and their corresponding rock stages: from
                      oldest to youngest these ages or stages are the Aquitanian, Burdigalian, Langhian, Serravallian,
                      Tortonian, and Messinian. The Miocene followed the Oligocene Epoch of the Paleogene Period and was
                      succeeded by the Pliocene Epoch.[21]
                      <br><br>

                      During the Miocene, land-dwelling mammals were essentially modern; many archaic groups were
                      extinct by the end of the preceding Oligocene, and fully half of the mammalian families known
                      today are present in the Miocene record. In the Northern Hemisphere, some interchange of faunas
                      occurred between the Old and New Worlds. Interchange was also possible between Africa and Eurasia,
                      but South America and Australia remained isolated. During the Miocene, horse evolution occurred
                      mainly in North America; forms such as Parahippus, Miohippus (a form carried over from the
                      preceding Oligocene Epoch), Anchitherium, Hypohippus, Pliohippus, and Merychippus are genera that
                      represent great diversification and development. Also, the first dogs and bears appeared; the
                      timing of the first emergence of the bear-dog Hemicyon occurs close to the origin of the bears.
                      The first hyenas, springing from primitive civets, appeared in the Miocene, as did the first
                      sabre-toothed cats of the subfamily Machairodontinae. Primitive antelope, deer, and giraffes
                      appeared in Eurasia during the Miocene. Ancestors of the modern elephants, which during the
                      preceding Oligocene seem to have been limited to Africa, appear to have spread to the Eurasian
                      continent during the Miocene and became more diverse.[21]
                      <br><br>

                      In Argentina the Santa Cruz Formation of Middle Miocene time provides an excellent record of the
                      unusual Miocene fauna of South America. Marsupial carnivores, aberrant endentates (mammals
                      resembling anteaters, armadillos, and sloths), litopterns (hoofed mammals similar to horses and
                      camels), and toxodonts (mammals with long, curved incisors) are among the odd groups represented.
                      These forms were able to evolve because of South America’s isolation from other regions. The
                      evolution of the South American monkeys was also under way during the Miocene.[21]
                      <br><br>

                      By the end of the Miocene Epoch almost all the modern groups of whales had appeared, as had the
                      early seals and walruses. Birds such as herons, rails, ducks, eagles, hawks, crows, sparrows,
                      pheasants, owls, and partridges were present in Europe, where the uplifting of the Alps continued
                      through Miocene time.[21]
                      <br><br>

                      The Miocene Epoch is of great importance to primate evolution. The oldest primate to occur in the
                      fossil record of North America, a 55-million-year-old tarsier-like creature called Teilhardina
                      magnoliana, is known in the southern United States, but all North American primates died out by
                      the end of the Eocene Epoch (about 33.9 million years ago) as the region’s climate cooled.
                      Elsewhere, the higher primates, especially the apes, underwent a great deal of evolution. The
                      fossil evidence seems to indicate that advanced primates, including apes, were present in southern
                      Europe. An early form, which was gibbonlike in appearance but only distantly related to the
                      gibbons, Pliopithecus, was found in the Miocene rocks of Europe. The dryopithecines, a group of
                      advanced humanlike apes that probably represent the stock from which modern apes and humans
                      originated, are also found in Europe’s Miocene rocks and are present in the Miocene strata of
                      Africa as well, the region where humanlike forms as well as modern humans probably originated.
                      (See also Dryopithecus.)[21]
                      <br><br>

                      In the oceans, the Miocene was a time of changing circulation patterns, probably due to global
                      cooling. Patterns of oceanic nutrient distribution changed, leading to increased productivity in
                      some regions and decreased productivity in others. The Miocene was a time of accelerated evolution
                      among marine plankton and mollusks, many groups showing increases in biological diversity.
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Pliocene Epoch</b></h4>
                      Pliocene Epoch, second of two major worldwide divisions of the Neogene Period, spanning the
                      interval from about 5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch
                      (23 million to 5.3 million years ago) and is further subdivided into two ages and their
                      corresponding rock stages: the Zanclean (5.3 million to 3.6 million years ago) and the Piacenzian
                      (3.6 million to 2.6 million years ago). The Pliocene Epoch precedes the Pleistocene Epoch of the
                      Quaternary Period.[22]
                      <br><br>

                      Pliocene environments were generally cooler and drier than those of preceding epochs, as revealed
                      by the remains of plants and trees, but marine records indicate that an interval around 3.0–3.5
                      million years ago may have been a relatively warm period, at least in the North Atlantic.[22]
                      <br><br>

                      A very modern aspect is seen in Pliocene terrestrial vertebrate faunas of the Northern Hemisphere.
                      Older groups of animals became extinct throughout the preceding Miocene Epoch. Although
                      similarities are evident between the faunas of Eurasia and North America, little faunal
                      interchange appears to have occurred between the two regions. The similarities are probably due to
                      the continuation of forms that migrated between the two areas late in the Miocene. It is likely
                      that during the Early Pliocene a remarkably homogeneous fauna existed from Spain and Africa to
                      China. Mastodons (elephant-like animals) underwent a great evolutionary diversification during the
                      Pliocene, and many variant forms developed, adapted to varying ecological environments. In North
                      America, rhinoceroses became extinct. Camels, some of large size, were abundant and diverse, as
                      were horses.[22]
                      <br><br>

                      The more-advanced primates continued to evolve in the Pliocene, with australopithecines, the first
                      creatures that can be termed human, appearing early in the epoch. A burst of particularly rapid
                      evolutionary change and diversification in primates, as well as other African mammals, appears to
                      have occurred around 2.5 million years ago near the boundary of the Pliocene and Pleistocene,
                      possibly connected to drying associated with the expansion of northern hemisphere glaciers around
                      this time. The land connection between North and South America became reestablished in the
                      mid-Pliocene, around 3.5 million years ago, allowing a number of terrestrial mammals including
                      ground sloths, glyptodonts (large, armadillo-like, armoured animals), armadillos, opossums, and
                      porcupines to appear in the Late Pliocene fossil record of North America. (Previously, they had
                      been isolated on the South American continent.)[22]
                      <br><br>

                      Marine faunas (including corals, predatory gastropods, and others) in the Western Atlantic and
                      Caribbean experienced a period of transition during the Late Pliocene, with many forms becoming
                      extinct and others appearing for the first time. These changes have been attributed to variations
                      in both temperature and oceanic nutrient supplies in the region.[22]

                        worldwide have been altered. These variations in turn have driven rapid changes in life-forms,
                        both flora and fauna. Beginning some 200,000 years ago, they were responsible for the rise of
                        modern humans.[23]

                        The length of the Quaternary is short relative to geologic and evolutionary time scales, but the
                        rate of evolutionary change during this period is high. It is a basic tenet of ecology that
                        disturbance increases diversity and ultimately leads to evolutionary pressures. The Quaternary
                        is replete with forces of disturbance and evidence for evolution in many living systems.
                        Examples of disturbance include the direct destruction of habitat by glacial advance, the drying
                        of vast plains, increases in size of lakes, a decrease in the area of warm, shallow, continental
                        shelves and carbonate banks, and shifts in ocean currents and fronts.[23]

                      <h4><b>Quaternary life</b></h4>


                      <h4><b>Fauna and flora</b></h4>

                      Ninety percent of the animals represented by Quaternary fossils were recognized by Charles Lyell
                      as being similar to modern forms. Many genera and even species of shellfish, insects, marine
                      microfossils, and terrestrial mammals living today are similar or identical to their Pleistocene
                      ancestors. However, many Pleistocene fossils demonstrate spectacular differences. For example,
                      sabre-toothed cats, woolly mammoths, and cave bears are widely known from museum exhibits and
                      popular literature but are extinct today. Expansion of some environments, such as vast dry steppe
                      grasslands, were favourable areas for bison, horses, antelopes, and their predators. Some species
                      with modern relatives, including the woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros, were clearly adapted to
                      the cold tundra regions because of their heavy fur. Some, such as the modern musk ox, would have
                      been right at home.[24]
                      <br><br>

                      The Pleistocene is generally recognized as a time of gigantism in terrestrial mammals. The causes
                      for such gigantism are not completely understood, but they most likely include a response to
                      colder conditions and an improved ability to resist predators and reach food higher on shrubs or
                      buried beneath snow. Examples of giant Pleistocene mammals include the giant beaver, giant sloth,
                      stag-moose, dire wolf, giant short-faced bear of the New World, and cave bear of the Old World.
                      The woolly mammoth and mastodon are rivaled in size only by modern elephants. Other animals
                      displayed extremes in body architecture, for example, the huge canine teeth of sabre-toothed cats.
                      It is suggested that an “arms race” between predators and their prey led to these extreme
                      developments.[24]
                      <br><br>

                      Whereas unusually large animals capture people’s imaginations, plant fossils are often the
                      workhorse of Quaternary scientists. Pollen is one of the most important tools of correlation in
                      terrestrial settings, and it is often used to extend knowledge from well-dated sequences to less
                      clear situations. Fossil pollen is particularly useful because it is almost indestructible when
                      trapped in lake and bog sediments. Pollen is representative of local and regional plant
                      communities and is diagnostic of humid versus dry periods and temperature changes. Changing
                      patterns of pollen can thus trace deglaciation and shifts in vegetation zones. Unlike animals,
                      plants do not migrate; however, plant assemblages gradually adjust to long-term changes in
                      humidity and temperature. The classic pollen assemblages of northern Europe have long been used to
                      subdivide the latest Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. In southern Scandinavia these zones track
                      abrupt shifts such as the Younger Dryas cooling and the gradual early Holocene change from boreal
                      to warmer climate assemblages. There were alterations in the abundance of various plants during
                      the changes, and many environments typical of deglaciation or the early Holocene would have looked
                      quite different from the groups that occupy relatively similar climate zones today. For example, a
                      fossil site in Pennsylvania dating to about 12,500 years ago records an environment of open land
                      with scattered spruce, pine, and birch trees, bearing some aspects of tundra and some of prairie.
                      No modern counterparts to this mixed environment exist today. Pollen compilations in North America
                      track spruce, oak, pine, maple, and other species in a cinematic series of diagrams showing these
                      changes over the past 18,000 years.[24]
                      <br><br>

                      An expansion of dry shortgrass prairie in the rain shadow of the Rocky Mountains may have put
                      tallgrass grazers such as horses and camels at a disadvantage compared with bison. On the other
                      hand, expansion of lakes spread many fishes to new sites, some of which are found today in refugia
                      of small ponds that remained as the connected glacial lakes retreated. One extreme example is the
                      spread of the prickly sculpin across the Continental Divide in British Columbia. This fish was
                      able to move from the south and west-flowing Fraser River to the north and east-flowing Parsnip
                      River, apparently as a consequence of ice that temporarily dammed the Fraser.[24]
                      <br><br>

                      Evolution in mollusks can be tracked in Pleistocene deposits on the coastal plains of the eastern
                      and southern United States, around the Baltic Sea, and other gently sloping continental margins.
                      It is likely that changing sea levels and shifts of marine regions played a part in the
                      evolutionary pressure. For example, the present U.S. East Coast can be divided at prominent sites
                      such as Cape Hatteras and Georges Bank, where biogeographic regions are controlled by coastal
                      currents, primarily owing to water temperature. At times during the Pleistocene, subtropical
                      conditions extended to the Carolinas and even Virginia. These periods alternated with
                      cooler-than-normal conditions. The rapid shifts in sea level and latitudinal ecosystems created
                      disturbance and mixing of different ecological assemblages, which in turn accelerated evolutionary
                      pressure.[24]
                      <br><br>

                      Ice age extinctions were not democratic. Most of the animals that became extinct at the end of the
                      Pleistocene were large, and both herbivores and carnivores were affected. This is particularly
                      true in North and South America as well as Australia. Many hypotheses have been proposed for this
                      record, but the “prehistoric overkill hypothesis” blames human hunting for the demise of large
                      animals wherever humans arrived during the past 40,000 to 13,000 years. This concept envisions
                      bands of human hunters sweeping south into the new lands, meeting animals unafraid of these
                      unfamiliar creatures. There are many objections to this theory, including the lack of sufficient
                      linkage between the hunters and the hunted in the archaeological record, the likely small numbers
                      of human hunters, and the survival of bison and other large species. Most important, however, is
                      that the record of decline and extinction in many cases precedes evidence for humans in the New
                      World and Australia. Other likely causes for extinction include loss or change of habitats, direct
                      climatic effects, and changes in the length and intensity of summer and winter conditions.
                      Predators that went extinct in the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs include the dire
                      wolf, American lion, sabre-toothed cat, American cheetah, and short-faced bear. Extinct grazers
                      and browsers include mammoths and mastodons, shrub oxen, woodland musk oxen, camels, llamas, two
                      genera of deer, two genera of pronghorn antelope, stag-moose, and five species of Pleistocene
                      horses. Horses did not return to the New World until shipped across the Atlantic by the Spanish
                      conquistadors.[24]
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Hominin evolution</b></h4>

                      American paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba and other scientists have suggested that climate changes
                      2.5 million years ago accelerated the evolution of hominins (members of the human lineage), giving
                      rise to our genus, Homo. The details of this process, and the exact pathways of ancestors and
                      descendants, are highly controversial (see human evolution). Even so, most paleoanthropologists
                      and archaeologists believe that a shift from forests to drier savanna lands in Africa imposed
                      evolutionary pressures that favoured an upright stance and ability to run and walk long distances.
                      This posture freed the hands for grasping and made possible the eventual use of tools. Homo
                      fossils suggest a migration out of Africa to China and Java as early as 1.8 million years ago
                      during the middle of the Pleistocene. This “Out of Africa” theory is now interpreted as multiple
                      events over many millennia. H. erectus was well established in eastern and southeastern Asia by
                      one million years ago. Another distinctive human precursor (H. antecessor) arrived in Atapuerca,
                      Spain, by 800,000 years ago. A human ancestor named H. heidelbergensis is found from sites in
                      Africa, Europe, and possibly Asia. These fossils date to between 600,000 and 200,000 years ago.
                      There is no more controversial subject in this field than the identity and fate of the next major
                      group, the Neanderthals (H. neanderthalensis), who lived between 200,000 and 30,000 years ago in
                      Europe and western Asia. Most recent work suggests that Neanderthals were not the direct ancestors
                      of modern humans. Both H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens may have evolved from H.
                      heidelbergensis.[25]
                      <br><br>

                      Modern humans (H. sapiens) first appeared in Africa about 200,000 years ago. They arrived in the
                      Middle East about 100,000 years ago, apparently living in the same environmental settings as the
                      Neanderthals. By 45,000–43,000 years ago, modern humans had begun to settle in Europe, but in less
                      than 10,000 years they supplanted Neanderthals completely. H. sapiens also spread into Asia and
                      across the narrow seaways of Java, the Sunda Islands, and New Guinea to Australia by at least
                      50,000 years ago. Spread of humans into the New World was delayed until possibly as late as
                      14,000–13,300 years ago, although there is evidence for earlier colonization. A wealth of evidence
                      is available in Europe for the development of human technology and culture during the Upper
                      Paleolithic through Neolithic cultural stages, ranging from the skillfully crafted stone, bone,
                      and wooden tools found in many locations to rare but revealing cave art. These artifacts can be
                      interpreted in various ways, but they clearly were the product of intelligent and emotionally
                      complex humans.[25]
                      <br><br>

                      It is probably no coincidence that after the strictures imposed by cold and rapidly changing
                      Pleistocene climates and landscapes, human civilization and recorded history arose during the more
                      amenable climate of the Holocene. However, even in these quieter times, vast climate and sea-level
                      disruptions have occurred. In the late 1990s evidence of catastrophic flooding of the Black Sea
                      was discovered. The event took place approximately 8,000 years ago and would have flooded
                      settlements and displaced peoples, possibly accelerating the dispersal of Neolithic foragers and
                      farmers into Europe.[25]
                      <br><br>

                      Vivid cave paintings, such as those in Lascaux, France, as well as rock engravings in Australia
                      and many other parts of the world, depict bison, antelope, horse, mammoth, and other animals with
                      which humans interacted during the Late Pleistocene. Many tools were obviously intended for
                      hunting both large and small game. Other tools are interpreted as specialized scrapers for hides
                      and awls for sewing skins. Rare finds of mammoth and other animals with stone points embedded in
                      the bones or closely associated with the skeletons attest to the hunting of animals. In addition,
                      camps in Siberia have tent circles composed of woolly mammoth jaws and tusks. These could have
                      come from either hunted or scavenged animals. Like Stone Age peoples known from recent centuries,
                      these hunter-gatherers used the meat, bones, hides, and sinews of animals, along with many plants,
                      for food, tools, and shelter. It is clear that these animal resources were critical to survival,
                      especially in the cold regions.[25]
